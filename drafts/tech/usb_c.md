# Impressions of USB-C

**Problems:**

* Fragmented: One Adapter for everything -> Not all cables hold the same functionality (fragmented as USB 2 / USB 3 / Thunderbolt)
* Not all combinations do work (e.g. USB A to USB C with )
* Varying Data Rates due to different cables and underlying standards
* Right equipment can be expensive

**Advantages:**

* Once you got the right hubs and gadgets huge benefits
* Actually no dongle-hell if done right! (PowerBank, which can charge laptop, phone, etc. / Only charger needed: the one from the laptop / HUBs provide a plethora of features like: Ethernet, HDMI, USB ports, SD-Cards etc.)
* EXTERNAL ... GRAPHICS!! Nough said!
* A lot of cool gadgets (mag-safe adapters, power-meter, hubs, etc.)

**Conclussion:**

* Might take some time to get main-stream (Power-Delivery Standard seem to be the right way in that regard)
* Power-Meter makes sense to check how the gadgets are actually working!
* For Tech-Savvy Persons: Holds huge advantages!
